:: You have to download and edit the paths(notepad++) of all the tools below (you may not have to download them all).

:: The default output folder is wherever you place the "DoVi_Scripts" folder.  A Windows drive (C:\) is not recommended

:: You can change the output path: Example: " set output_path=D:\Video.Folder\ "

:: You can change the temp path Example: "set temp_folder=F:\TEMP.folder" but know that each workflow will delete whatever the path you set when the job is done. So dont put a temp like C:\ or C:\Users\username\Documents, always change to a non-existing folder.

:: You can use an external settings file, see the example below

:: Click on the DoVi_Scripts.bat, select a mode, a workflow, drag and drop input, and wait...

:: MANY THANKS TO ALL THE CREATORS OF THE TOOLS/CODES I'M USING IN THESE SCRIPTS.

:: In case of issues, most of the time, just remove special characters or space from the path/filename

:: If drag and drop doesnt work on Windows 11, reset your Windows security to default and reboot.

:: You can use external bat files for the paths and settings. (PATHS.bat / SETTINGS.bat)

:: Sorry for my English...

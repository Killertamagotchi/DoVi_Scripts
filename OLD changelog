RELEASE NOTES:


1.9.5
- added audio support in (7-5-4)(7-5-3).... so now if your PC can handle it, you can watch FEL and P5 videos in MPC + madVR
- 6-2 can now measure Profile 5 DV with madvr(slow) and added an option to plot only max_pq (line 135)
- bugfix: fix the L2L3L8L5L6 plot bug introduced in the last version when the output path is not on at the drive root.
- bugfix: MP4 version batch muxer(5) processed the video two times

1.9.4
- merged the external path and settings together. The external settings file should now be like this:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u8Q_drQp2CdWpqZwHfdLuvHkPoVLcOf-/view?usp=drive_link 
- NEW workflow (7-5) that can play FEL or P5 with madvr + MPC and moved the MPV workflow into (7). Need mpc folder: https://www.videohelp.com/software/Media-Player-Classic-Home-Cinema  (need to be the portable version) This is only for exporting screenshots with madvr because there won't be any audio support here.
- (7) bugfix in screenshot menu order
- added an option for force multi-thread in dovi baker at line 127(modify it according to your CPU): default = set Prefetch=Prefetch(8)

1.9.3
-- Merged all the mp4muxer workflows and improved multi-track support. You'll want to turn off 7.1 EC3 encoding since the newest mp4box can’t mux them properly (old mp4box  works fine).
-- set container=MP4:  added an option to force the mp4muxer for some EC3 tracks that cant be muxed in mp4box (line 64) default=NO
-- set container=MP4: this mp4muxer version is now required: https://github.com/bbeny123/mp4muxer/releases
-- set container=MP4: MP4BOX must be updated to the latest version https://www.videohelp.com/software/MP4Box
-- moved plotter and screenshot maker on the main menu.
- (3-1) auto-fix rpu input when the first frame doesnt start with a scene cut.
- (3-1) frame by frame can now be triggered at line 104 set force.FBF=YES  Default = NO
- (7-4) now supports P5 input (cropped input not supported for the heatmap)
- (7-3) Speed improvement for P5 input and no longer requires a Vulkan GPU.
- (7-1) Line 130 Can now be forced to use ffms2 for those who dont have an Nvidia GPU. For some reason, avspmod need to parse all the frame 1 time so be patient. Better than nothing i guess…. (default = NO)
-- (3-1)(3-2) merged together. 
-- (1-1)(3-1) if the rpu (input 2) and the BL (input 1) have the same filename/path, it will be automatically used.
-- (3-1)(2-1-2) can now use external config bat Files for L5 and MD must have the same name/folder as the input example: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cxGCIvP0qnhTzwIb_Up-BsQXrHGMwuM6/view?usp=drive_link 
-- You do not have to change your paths/settings every update anymore, the script can now use external bat files for paths and settings(must be tools\PATHS.bat and tools\SETTINGS.bat)
 (examples: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMiiObwZ7uWJDW3PzcS9FlWm4UNa5Qk6/view?usp=drive_link  / https://drive.google.com/file/d/10A6nckce6Ma0waLARKHL3yWB4_jwLR2q/view?usp=drive_link  see 1.9.4
-- 6-4 can now batch plot
-- you can now associate the rpu file (or any dv file) to the script.bat and it will launch (2-3 quick dv info) if you click on any rpu. You can drag and drop any file on the bat file as well. https://i.ibb.co/TwpkB3q/u-XDEc-Yy-Sh-Y.gif


1.9.2 
-- 6-2-2 HDR10 plotter can now batch process as many files as you want.

-- 3-1 cm_analyze can be forced to use the CPU (line 64 set CM_CPU=YES)
-- NEW workflow: 3-2 cm_analyze batch convert HDR10 to DV only with existing shot list(or generate one with madvr) or frame by frame.
-- NEW (5)(2-1-2)(2-1-5)(3-4)(3-2) batch workflows can now input a folder with files instead of each file one by one. Make sure only the files you want to process are in the folder because the script will try to process ANY file in that folder.
-- NEW (5)(2-1-2)(2-1-5)(3-4)(3-2)(6-2-2) batch workflows : removed the 13 files limit. Now can batch-process as many files as you want

1.8.0
-- (2-7)  New workflow that can auto-detect the frame difference between two sources.
This workflow will export the first and middle frames of each shot for 4000 frames and will try to find out the difference but it may not find one or it can be incorrect. It’s better and safer to calculate it with the extracted png frame numbers. New tool is needed for this workflow.

-- NEW (7-1-1)(7-2-1)(7-2-2) MP4muxer workflows can now encode 7.1 EC3 audio.
-- NEW workflow that can batch remove CMV4.0 metadata block (2-1-6):
most of the CMV4.0 movies only have a L8 100nits trims and L2 has no effect on CMV4.0 device(shield, firestick ,appletv, tv internal). Movies Anywhere M3GAN is a good example, the L2 trims makes the image much brighter than HDR10/L1 alone but not on a CMV4.0 device.
CMV4.0 original: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lR1u9H ... share_link
cmv4.0 removed: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZqS9Ml ... share_link

-- (1-1) can now inject P5 metadata to P5 BL if you put "P5BL" in the base layer filename input.
-- (6-2-3) dovi plotter will now skip the first two frames to avoid incorrect MDL reading for some MA titles.
-- (6-8) Added a new workflow that can make 6 SDR screenshots from two sources(SDR/HDR10/P5-DV). With frame difference adjustments support. It will upscale to 2160p by default but can be disabled by adding "DONTUPSCALE" in the input filename. This workflow is very slow and requires Vulkan gpu support. It exports YUV TIFF that can only be opened in MPC. I have to improve this, if anyone knows how to export a lossless png screenshot that retains the original colors and brightness via CLI, please let me know. IM also not satisfied with libplacebo tone mapping, have to test more settings. Any help is welcome.

– Big change: All the workflows that convert audio are now merged together. By default, the script will always mux to TS. You can disable or set it to mux to MKV. If you input an MKV with THD, the script will add a silent core automatically if set to TS muxing (or popup). For mkv muxing, there's an option to mux only 1 lossless audio or all the audio tracks from the input.
If the input is HEVC , audio conversion and muxing are disabled.

-- Input with special characters support as well as some filename conflicts should be greatly improved. Hopefully, this will also fix some issues for those who use the script on a Windows C:\ drive
-- Added batch workflow mkv/ts/m2ts to mp4 for old mp4muxer mode. (7-2-8)
-- Mode.I Mode.F and Mode.P will now display the original DV input active area,L2 trims, max/min pq, and profile before running the job

-- TrueHD to TrueHD+ac3 now auto-select the right ID based on language and audio track order.
-- Mp4 workflows now use mkvextract(mkv) or tsmuxer(ts/m2ts), no more slow EAC3To.exe. The audio track selection should be improved.
-- Added xml support for Dovi plotter (6-2-3)
-- Added a code to exclude the Commentary tracks from audio selection (only works if the input has the track title set to "commentary")
-- Bugfix: Mode.4 didn't work with special characters input
-- Bugfix: (7-1) mp4box didn't work if the input was  not 23.976fps

-- Bugfix: (6-2-2) madvr Measurement files input didn't work
-- Bugfix: Drop HDR10plus option didn't work if BL input was raw HEVC
-- eac3to.exe is very slow to demux when the source has many subtitle tracks but can demux all the tracks of any container without knowing the IDs which you cannot do with ffmpeg/mkvextract/tsmuxer. It was complicated to do(for me) but as I get better, I found a way to map the track IDs and I'm now using mkvextract to demux mkv and tsmuxer for ts/m2ts files (excluding the mp4 workflow). It may break non-English settings, I just need to find the proper language tag.
– Added a couple of warnings for when the user tries to input the wrong files in the wrong workflow.

- merged the 5.1 and 7.1 DD+ workflows(mode.I / mode.F / mode.H / mode.P) by default , it will encode 7.1 ec3 if source have 7.1 audio(5.1 encoding can be forced).
- code clean up

1.5.8
-Bugfix: forgot to remove the 4gb wav limit for the 7.1 EC3 workflows

1.5.7

-updated mp4box to the latest version that fixes the "not present" issue with EAC3 atmos track (7-4) (this is only for the Apple iOS workflows)
-7.1 EC3 audio can now be encoded without DEE with Easy Audio Encoder (FREE)(do not remux with tsmuxer though)(6-3-8)
-7.1 workflows (except Mode.M(6-3)) have been replaced by EAE (do not remux with tsmuxer though)

- added dual-track dual-layer input support for the P7 MKV/TS/M2TS to p8 workflows (speed increase too when input is fel) (4-2)
- added dual-track dual-layer  input support for the dovi plotter workflow (6-2-3)
- DV plotter workflow can now batch process up to 13 files (rpu or mkv/ts/m2ts) (6-2-3)
- BDMV to p8: slight speed increase (only when input is fel) (4-1)
- Audio encoder: DDP 5.1 (ffmpeg) now ask you to set the track id (useful when lossless audio is not id 1. If you skip, default=1) (6-3-4)

1.5.5
- 7-1-1 didnt work. Thanks @xxyz1

1.5.4
- HDR10 plotter didnt work since last update
- added P7 support for Mode.I (1)

1.5.3
- Profile 7 MKV input to P8 menu order was messed up. Thank’s @realbabilu 

1.5.2
- updated dovi_tool: refresh scene flag fixer workflows now work. (MODE.F)
- small fix in mp4muxer EC3 workflow for no lossless audio input. Thanks @duder
- New workflows that can plot the brightness of HDR10 and DV. (two inputs) (MODE.F)

1.5.1
- HDR10plus version 0 is now supported. (except the mp4muxer and batch workflows)
- Added a Dovi and HDR10plus measurer/plotter (you need python and all the modules it will ask you to install: ijson etc..). This one too https://pypi.org/project/colour-science/

1.5.0
- The P5 to P8 workflows will now automatically fix the AppleTV RPUs that have invalid L6 metadata (MDL>10 000).
- changed DRC profile to music_light in the DEE 7.1 EC3 workflows. https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1972689#post1972689

1.4.9
- added option to keep a copy of EL when doing P7 to P8 (default = NO)
- there was another issue with proper audio selection for some bluray input to p8 workflows
- added a workflow that just makes 5min MKV sample. ( in MODE.M)
- fixed a couple of errors in the rpu fixer mode (when input was a rpu)

1.4.8
-  fixed wrong audio selection in the mp4muxer bluray input mode

1.4.7
- Merged the L5/L6/duplicate/remove fixer and added an option to fix incorrect refresh scene flags. (Mode.F)  (only the removal of duplicated flag works right now. waiting for quietvoid dovitool new version that will add flags)
- P7 mode is back in the main menu.
- added non-english support for the P7 input workflows
- P8 to P5 batch mode didn't work.
- merged the auto and manual L5 workflows. More questions to answer but remember you can always skip by pressing "enter".
- code clean-up

1.4.6
- added a batch edit L5 mode
- added appletv compatible mp4muxer mode/workflows with SRT and LPCM 7.1 audio support
- you must download the full pack with tools if you want the appleTV workflows to work.
- added non-English audio support for the mp4muxer modes. (limited language support, ask me for more or edit the bat file)
- MKV/TS/M2TS to mp4muxer workflows now accept P8 input as well as P7 like before (workflow 4-5)
- TEMP_folder can now be edited
- added DD+ 7.1 @1536kbps workflow for the MODE.I (only works if you have  DEE)
- HDR10plus and madvr DV generation are now in cmv2.9 instead of 4.x (no point making 4.x without L8)
- you can set "echo on" in the first line of the script to expose the command lines. (in case of need to debug)
1.4.5
- forgot to add the improvements of 1.4.4 in the AUTO-L5 workflows. sorry

1.4.4
- P5 to P8 synchronization changes/improvements:

remove frames: The script will now remove frames after frame 0 in order to keep refresh scene=1 for frame 0
duplicate frames: The script will now duplicate frame 1 instead of frame 0 to avoid having multiple refresh_scene in a row
*** I suspect this is the reason why some RPU didn't work on the Zidoo/Dune player.

1.4.3
-bugfix: mp4muxer EC3 mode didn't work since I added the ability to choose the audio bitrate (typo)
-bugfix: the EC3 encoding workflows didn't pick the right track for some BD with DTSHD commentary track. (EG. out of sight BD)
-Mode xml/rpu and mode p5 to p8 merged together. This mode can now do pretty much anything (that I can think of):
input HDR10-BL and RPU or XML + all edit
input HDR10-BL and any P5 file + all edit
input HDR10-BL and any P8 file + all edit
input P5-BL and any P5 file + all edit

1.4.2
- updated tsmuxer.
- merged xml and rpu injector workflows together
- merged p5 and p7 input modes together
- renamed and changed the modes order a bit

1.4.1
- p5 to p8 workflows will now export scene/shot cut to a text file for double-checking synchronization.
- p5 to p8 workflows won't keep a copy of the converted rpu anymore by default. If you want the rpu like before, edit the bat file and set keep_rpu=YES
- added a "script has completed" popup box

1.4.0
- updated dovi_tool
- added an rpu info summary for all the workflows that extract/convert/read the rpu
- added audio conversion workflows for the L5 edit mode (MODE.F ---> Workflow.6)
- added bitrate parser (works on my end but not sure if this will work everywhere)  (MODE.M → MODE.2 → Workflow.3)
- added madvr measurement analyzer that can make a brightness graphic. (MODE.M → MODE.2 → Workflow.2)

1.3.9
- bugfix: fixed the tsmuxer track id mismatch when demuxing TS/M2TS source

1.3.8
- bugfix: fixed HDR10 and HDR10plus TS input (untouched m2ts from BD still doesnt work, will fix later) thanks @dwalme

1.3.7
- added the ability to choose audio bitrate in the mp4muxer EC3 workflows
- bugfix DEE TrueHD encoding without a core didn't work
- bugfix DEE output files were missing the extension when input had space or special characters.
- code cleanup

1.3.6
- added: MODE.F==>Workflow.9= QUICKLY Export the 1st 5 min scene cuts to a text file for synchronization verification (fast).    V 1.3.5 that went online for a few hours had this mode but it wasn't working properly because ffmpeg was messing up the frames at splitting. This is why this version is 1.3.6, MODE.F==>Workflow.9 now uses tsmuxer and the frame remains accurate after splitting so it can be used to quickly check sync without having to demux the whole movie.
- added: new audio conversion workflows that use the Dolby Encoding Engine (dee.exe not included in the tools pack). If you have DEE, my script can now encode DD+ 7.1 audio @ 1536kbps with a core compatible with bluray players. DD+ without core is limited to 1024kbps. DEE can also encode lossless audio to TrueHD.
- added: the ability to choose the bitrate for the ffmpeg DD+ 5.1 encoding workflow. up to 256-1536kbps
- Reader/extractor rpu workflows are now in the MODE.F
- Renamed the old "READER mode.r" to "MIXED".


1.3.4
- added a mode that can export the scene cut to a text file for sync verification. Thank's @rkjnsn  (MODE.F==>Workflow.8)
- L5 fixer workflow can now fix BDMV and dual track TS/M2TS input and is now in the new Fixer/Editor/Verificator mode in the main menu: (MODE.F==> Workflow.6)
- DV and HDR10plus remover workflows didn't work. error in the menu selection
- added option to edit L5 when going from BD to P8(not for the mp4 mode though) because a lot of BD has incorrect or missing metadata: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1646bseZpS13lZx3QQqiobWaWDqwAiT6Iq2R4sCl7gtc/edit?usp=sharing I recommend always checking the source L5 before converting anything.


1.3.3
- "MODE.R ⇒ MODE.1 ⇒ Workflow.2 = Quick Read the rpu of any video"  will now tell you if the ST-DL profile 7 MKV  is FEL or MEL. The process only takes a few seconds…
- "MODE.R ⇒ MODE.1 ⇒ Workflow.2 = Quick Read the rpu of any video" can now read dual-track dual-layer M2TS from BD and will tell you if the disc is FEL or MEL. The process only takes a few seconds… Dual-track Dual-layer TS input will work as well in the next release.

1.3.2
- added HDR10(madVR) and HDR10plus to dovi MP4 workflows
- Merged HDR10(madVR) and HDR10plus to DoVi maker in 1 mode. Selection is automatic
- Added MPV P5/HDR10/HLG player. press S to export lossless screenshots.  (MODE.R= ---> MODE.9= MPV DV-P5/HDR10 ) PNG will be in Dolby-Vision-Tools\tools\MPV
- the frame to read in  "Workflow.1= Read and extract RPU metadata of any video" can be skipped
- Dovi_tool updated to the latest version

1.3.1
- bugfix: L5 fixer (rpu editor mode) didn't work if the input was MKV. TYPO
- improvement: HDR10 and HDR10plus to DoVi modes(except batch)  now correctly set L9 metadata according to the Mastering Display Primaries Color input instead of defaulting to P3.

1.3.0
- bugfix: 1.2.8 updates broke input with a special character in the filename.
- mp4muxer single track workflow 1 can now do pretty much anything:

if video input is raw hevc/h265, it can mux up to two audio tracks (1 lossless and 1 lossy or 2 lossy. both can be skipped) and up to two subtitles tracks(both can be skipped)
if video input is MKV/TS/M2TS, DV profile selection is automatic. AC3 audio is encoded or an existing lossy track is used if present in the source. 2 English srt tracks are muxed too( 1 full and 1 forced if present).
MKV Profile 7 to Profile 8 : SRT subtitles are now automated. Full and forced

Mp4muxer single track mode:
1) Workflow.1= ANY VIDEO (p5,p7,p8) + ANY AUDIO + SRT subtitle(external)
2) Workflow.2= Bluray Disc to Profile 8 + AC3 + SRT subtitles(external)
3) Workflow.3= Bluray Disc to Profile 8 + EC3 + SRT subtitles(external)
4) Workflow.4= MKV Profile 7 to Profile 8 + AC3 + SRT subtitles
5) Workflow.5= MKV Profile 7 to Profile 8 + EC3 + SRT subtitles

1.2.9
- added a new mp4muxer workflow that can convert bluray disc to profile 8 with AC3 instead of EC3 (some devices don't like EC3)
- added a new mp4muxer workflow that can convert P7 MKV to profile 8 with AC3 instead of EC3 (some devices don't like EC3)
- Mode.M4 ---> Mode.1 ---> Workflow.1 can now accept MKV/TS/M2TS input. It will convert lossless audio to AC3 or use the existing AC3/ EC3 track if present. It can also mux 2 subtitles (full and forced if present)
- Mode.M4 ---> Mode.1 ---> Workflow.1 can now mux a video without any audio input.

1.2.8
-added a mp4_muxer workflow that can mux 2 lossy audio tracks and 1 subtitle. I may add lossless audio in the future.

1.2.7
- no more cropping function in the P5 to P8 with manual L5 workflows. if you want to crop, use the Auto_L5 workflows
- if you skip any question (except input files), it will now default to false  or   n   or    will repeat the question
- added AAC/DTS/DTSHD/TrueHD support for the mp4muxer modes
- simplified the mp4muxer modes regarding the subtitles. You can just skip  if you don't want subs
- moved the "quick rpu read mode" into: MODE.R -->  MODE.1 ---> Workflow.2
- added a new workflow that can Demux, Fix invalid L6 metadata (some itunes web-dl), and Inject. MODE.R -->  MODE.7 ---> Workflow.7
- downgraded ffmpeg, I think there is an issue with DD+ encoding on the latest nightly. Some files ended up with only 5.0 channels.

1.2.6
- Since apparently, it is common for studios (or random release groups) to incorrectly set L5 (MA WEB-DLs and some bluray), I automated a new workflow that can Demux, Edit L5, and Inject the new rpu. (mode.r / mode.editor).
- Added a workflow that can merge existing AC3 and THD track from an MKV file instead of creating an empty core. (mode.r / audio)
- p5 to p8 duplicate with auto-l5 didn't work

1.2.5
-  hdr10plus to Dovi bach mode (manual l5) didn't work
-  added a workflow(mode.r / mode rpu editor) that can check the rpu metadata in just a few seconds for any files. useful to quickly check if the video has proper RPU (L5, L6, etc..)

1.2.4
- updated dovi_tool and ffmpeg
- removed yusesope scripts: P7 ST-DL files are now created by the dovi_tool. Faster!
- BD to P8 now mux and convert the rpu at the same time. Faster!
- bugfix mode.p7 mode.2 Workflow.1  didn't work

1.2.3
- wrong default output folder in 1.2.2, my bad.
- updated mkvmerge and hdr10plus_tool.

1.2.2
- removed the auto-muxing function (tsmuxer and mkvtoolnix) in the p5 to p8 batch mode because appletv files have fps headers problems (mkvtoolnix/tsmuxer sees the injected file as 25fps). Remember to set a proper frame rate in mkvtoolnix/tsmuxer before muxing appleTV files.
- Bugfix: typo in MODE.R / rpu editor / duplicator

1.2.1
- bugfix: fixed the pre-allocation issue with DGdemux for the Bluray folders input modes..

1.2.0
- bugfix: Bluray MPLS  to  P8-SL  &  P7-ST workflows were broken  since 1.1.8

1.1.9
- bugfix: the last version introduced a typo in the Mode.R / WF.1 read RPU.

1.1.8
- Figured out why special characters in filename without space didn't work. Now any input path/filename should work. (except for the batch modes, I'm busy right now, will fix it later)
- hdr10plus to dv didn't work with TS/M2ts input

1.1.7
-batch muxer modes: will now mux to TS or MKV(or no muxing) according to the script local parameters (noGUI.popup= YES or NO). Default= no muxing. This allowed me to remove over 3000 lines of code.
-the scripts didn't work if you renamed the tools folder with spaces or special characters(or if you placed the tools folder in a path with spaces). Now it should work (except for the mp4muxer modes which I don't really care about, I may never add support for that there, just dont rename it) -added a new workflow that can batch convert up to 13 P5 videos to P8 and mux to ts or mkv if selected(when both videos are in sync). I use this for tv shows episodes p5 to p8 web-dl.
-some code clean up and re-wording
-updated dovi_tool to the latest version.

1.1.6
Bugfix: rpu injector (mode 1 workflow 1) didn't work with hevc/h265 raw file input.

1.1.5
Bugfix: tool didn't work when the input files were in a different drive than the output folder.

1.1.4
now, there's no more need to treat the REMOVE frames workflow as inclusive, the script will automatically substract 1 from the user input.
